# üìä Capstone Project: Data-Driven HR Insights & Employee Attrition Prediction

This is the final project for my **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**, where I applied the full data analytics workflow to deliver actionable insights for a fictional HR department. The goal of the project is to identify key factors that influence employee attrition and to build a predictive model to help HR take proactive measures to improve retention.

## Project Overview

**Business Scenario:**  
Salifort Motors, a large automotive company, is facing challenges in employee retention. The HR department has collected internal data but lacks the analytical expertise to interpret it. I was tasked with analyzing this dataset and providing data-driven recommendations to answer the key business question:

> **What‚Äôs likely to make an employee leave the company?**

## üß† Key Objectives

- Understand and clean the HR dataset
- Explore key relationships and trends through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Identify important factors driving employee attrition
- Build and evaluate predictive models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Communicate findings with clarity for non-technical stakeholders

---

## üîç Tools & Skills Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Data Analysis Techniques**: Data cleaning, transformation, correlation analysis, feature engineering
- **Modeling Techniques**: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, GridSearchCV, Cross-validation
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
- **Workflow**: PACE Framework (Plan ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Construct ‚Üí Execute)

---

## üìà Project Highlights

- Identified that **low satisfaction level**, **long work hours**, and **lack of promotion** are key indicators of attrition.
- Achieved a classification model with strong performance on F1 and ROC-AUC scores.
- Visualized impactful trends (e.g., attrition by department, satisfaction level distributions).
- Created interpretable models and provided **clear business recommendations** for HR teams to reduce attrition.

## ‚úÖ Outcomes & Learning

Through this project, I strengthened my end-to-end data analytics capabilities ‚Äî from understanding messy real-world problems to building interpretable machine learning solutions. I practiced stakeholder communication and focused on using data to **drive business impact**, a critical skill for any data analyst.
